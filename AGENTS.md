This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from
your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any

# AGENTS.md

The canonical, always-read guide for this repo is **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** — read it first.
This file is the cross-tool pointer (agents that look for `AGENTS.md`); it summarizes only the
must-not-break rules. CLAUDE.md is the source of truth.

## What this is

A Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui app driven by a DTCG design-token system,
re-pointed to an **Apple** visual language. Every component is documented at "assignment depth":
state/variant stories in `stories/manual/**`, a 1:1 MDX doc in `stories/docs/**` (bound via
`<Meta of={…}>`), and a component-tier token block in `tokens/*.tokens.json`.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never hardcode colors.** Use semantic token classes only (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`,
   `border-border`, `bg-primary`) — no hex, no `text-gray-500`. CI enforces this outside
   `components/ui` (`npm run audit:components` → rule #1). A sanctioned arbitrary value must carry
   a `ds-allow-hardcode` comment on its line.
2. **Tokens are generated.** Edit `tokens/*.tokens.json`, then run `npm run tokens:build` to
   regenerate `app/tokens.generated.css`. CI fails on drift. Don't hand-edit the generated CSS.
3. **Own, don't fork.** `components/ui/*` are shadcn primitives — add via `npx shadcn@latest add`;
   keep edits token-driven.
4. **Docs are 1:1.** Each component has exactly one `stories/docs/*.mdx` bound with
   `<Meta of={XStories} />`. Manual stories carry **no** `tags: ["autodocs"]` (an attached MDX
   does not replace autodocs — both would render, duplicating the Docs entry).
5. **Tailwind v4 idioms:** `size-4` not `w-4 h-4`; `tw-animate-css`; `React.ComponentProps<>` over
   `forwardRef`. Server Components by default; `"use client"` only at the interactive leaf.

## Verify before you push

```bash
npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
npm run test-storybook   # render-smoke + play + axe a11y (205 tests)
npm run audit            # AUDIT.md (rule #1) [+ VARIANTS.md when a Figma token is set]
```

## Figma

Code is the source of truth; sync **code → Figma** via the Figma MCP (the REST PAT is dead).
Colors in Figma must be applied via **alias/semantic** variables only — semantic vars **alias
primitives**, never hold raw values. See CLAUDE.md → "Figma MCP Integration Rules".
